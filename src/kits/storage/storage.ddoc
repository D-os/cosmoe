\defgroup storage The Cosmoe highlevel filesystem API

This section will take you trough the Cosmoe highlevel filesystem API.
C++ programs can take advantage of this API to get easy access to the
filesystem.

NOTE: Throughout this documentation the name "file" might be used on
any nodes located in the FS so a "file" might not be a regular file
but can also be a directory or symlink depending on the context where
the name is used.
