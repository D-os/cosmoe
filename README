Welcome to Cosmoe 0.7.2!


INSTALLATION
------------
Cosmoe is built using the same method as most open-source software:

./configure
make
 { become root }
make install

If you have DirectFB installed on your computer, and you would like
to hack the (non-working) DirectFB driver, configure like so:

./configure --enable-directfb

The VESA and XWindows targets are no longer supported.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
Using any gcc version prior to 3.0 is unsupported and may fail to
compile Cosmoe.  gcc 2.96 (though not 2.95 or earlier) worked at one
point, but has not been tested by the author in quite some time.

Cosmoe is developed under Linux kernel 2.6.9 and gcc 3.4.2 using the
Fedora Core 3 distribution.  However, any kernel version 2.4.22 or
later, along with any version of gcc3 should be sufficient to compile
and run Cosmoe.  Cosmoe may also be configured and run under MacOS X
or NetBSD using XWindows or SDL output mode, or so I hear.

RUNNING COSMOE
--------------
Run the cosmoe.sh shell script as root to start Cosmoe

To quit Cosmoe, type exit in the shell or close the cterm window.

PROBLEMS
--------
If Cosmoe fails to compile for you, please let me know by e-mail.

If a Cosmoe app crashes, please send me a backtrace.

If the appserver crashes you can check the file server.out for some
hopefully helpful information.  If the terminal crashes you can check
the file cterm.out.

API DOCUMENTATION
-----------------
Since Cosmoe now conforms quite closely to the Be API, the best
API documentation to use is the BeBook, available at several sites
online.

You can also go to the libcosmoe directory and run "make doc" if you
have doxygen installed.  Limited html documentation will then be
produced in the docs directory inside the libcosmoe directory.

MAKING SOURCE CHANGES
---------------------
Source code improvements are welcomed!  Please visit www.cosmoe.com to
see the latest bug reports and enhancement requests.

If you are making source code changes to libcosmoe or the appserver, you
should run "make deps" to ensure that dependencies will be created and
used.  Once this command is run, the dependencies will automatically be
updated from that point forward until such time as a "make clean" or
"make distclean" is performed.

Any questions?  E-mail me (Bill Hayden) and I'll try to clear things up.
