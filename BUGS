Cosmoe known bugs as of 12/03/2004
----------------------------------

appserver hits assertions in Layer.cpp

Cosmoe cursor causes redraw problems when dragging a window

Cosmoe cursor is not masked correctly

Moving a Cosmoe windows outside the bounds of the enclosing X Window can cause
redraw problems

There is a race condition which causes Cosmoe to successfully launch only
about 90% of the time

Text redraw is slow

Floating point exception in port.c when an app closes

Bitmaps do not draw

Triangle, polygon, and rounded rect drawing is unimplemented

DirectFB driver compiles but does not work

Menus can be opened but not closed (other than selecting an item)

Once a window is moved, the window contents sometimes do not respond to clicks

Text does not draw when using BStringView

When a window is closed, the dirty region in any underlying windows is not updated (though the window border is)


Future enhancements (code donations accepted!)
-----------------------------------------

Cosmoe uses a Be-incompatible BFont implementation that is reference
counted on the client side instead of the server side.  This makes
anything to do with textual output very hard or impossible to port
from Be/Haiku.  Major work is required in Font.cpp, View.cpp, and
the appserver to support this.  The new code DOES work in 0.8, but
the backporting is non-trivial, to say the least.  This is a major
goal for 0.7.3.

Implement triangle, polygon, and rounded rect drawing.  This
requires changes in View.cpp, ServerProtocol.h, and render.cpp at
the least.  The driver code is done; only the communications code
to get the data from the View to the appserver Layer is missing.
The changes are very straightforward, however it is not a great
priority because nothing is using these functions at present.
